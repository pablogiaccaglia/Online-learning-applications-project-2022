# üìô Description

Imagine an ecommerce website which can sell an unlimited number of units of 5 different items without any storage cost.
In every webpage, a single product, called primary, is displayed together with its price. The user can add a number of units of this product to the cart. After the product has been added to the cart, two products, called secondary, are recommended. When displaying the secondary products, the price is hidden. Furthermore, the products are recommended in two slots, one above the other, thus providing more importance to the product displayed in the slot above. If the user clicks on a secondary product, a new tab on the browser is opened and, in the loaded webpage, the clicked product is displayed as primary together with its price. At the end of the visit over the ecommerce website, the user buys the products added to the cart.

We assume that the user has the following behavior:
- she/he buys a number of units of the primary product if the price of a single unit is under the user‚Äô reservation price; in other words, the users‚Äô reservation price is not over the cumulative price of the multiple units, but only over the single unit

- once the primary product has been bought, the user clicks on a secondary product with a probability depending on the primary product except when the secondary product has been already displayed as primary in the past, in this case the click probability is zero (thus, in practice, excluding the case in which a product is displayed as primary more than once --- as a result the number of webpages visited by the user is finite)

- when observing the secondary products, the user initially observes the first slot and, after having observed that slot, observes the second slot. Assume that the probability with which the first slot is observed is 1, while the probability with which the second slot is observed is lambda < 1. The value of lambda is assumed to be known in all the three project proposals.

Notice that the probability of a click on a secondary product depends on:
- the purchase probability of the primary product,
- the probability to observe the slot in which the secondary product is displayed, and the click probability of the secondary product conditioned to the purchase of the primary.

For simplicity, we make the following assumptions:
- the clicks on the secondary products are independent of each other and the user can click on multiple secondary products, so as to activate multiple parallel paths over the graph depicted above;
- the number of items a user will buy is a random variable independent of any other variable; that is, the user decides first whether to buy or not the products and, subsequently, in the case of a purchase, the number of units to buy;
- the actions performed by the users are perfectly observable by the ecommerce website.

Every day, there is a random number of potential new customers (returning customers are not considered here). In particular, every single customer can land on the webpage in which one of the 5 products is primary or on the webpage of a product sold by a (non-strategic) competitor. Call ùõº_i the ratio of customers landing on the webpage in which product Pi is primary, and call ùõº_0 the ratio of customers landing on the webpage of a competitor. In practice, you can only consider the ùõº ratios and disregard the total number of users. However, the ùõº ratios will be subject to noise. That is, every day, the value of the ùõº ratios will be realizations of independent Dirichlet random variables.

Consider the scenario in which:
- for every primary product, the pair and the order of the secondary products to display is fixed by the business unit and cannot be controlled,
- the price of every primary product is fixed and this price is equal, for simplicity, to the margin,
- there are 5 advertising campaigns, one per product, and, by a click to a specific ad, the user lands on the corresponding primary product.

The ecommerce website has a budget cap B to spend to advertise its products. For simplicity, assume that the automatic bidding feature provided by the platforms is used and therefore no bidding optimization needs to be performed. The change of the budget spent on the campaign for the product Pi changes the expected value of the corresponding ùõº_i, and therefore the number of users landing on the webpage in which product Pi is primary. For every campaign, you can imagine a maximum expected value of ùõº_i (say ùõº_i_bar) corresponding to the case in which the budget allocated on that campaign is infinite. Therefore, for every campaign, the expected value of ùõº_i will range from 0 to ùõº_i_bar, depending on the actual budget allocated to that campaign.

Things to implements:

- **Step 1: Environment.** Develop the simulator by Python. In doing so, imagine a motivating application and choose the probability distributions associated with every random variable. Assume that there are 2 binary features that define 3 different users‚Äô classes. The users‚Äô classes potentially distinguish for the ùõº ratio functions. More precisely, every class is characterized by a profile of ùõº functions, one per campaign. Given a campaign, the three classes may have different ùõº functions.

- **Step 2: Optimization algorithm.** Formally state the optimization problem where the objective function is the profit, defined as the difference between the expected margin and the spent in advertising. Design an exact, dynamic-programming algorithm to optimize the function when all the parameters are known. Notice that the value per click provided by an advertising campaign is the expected margin from landing to the corresponding product. Furthermore, in the dynamic-programming algorithm, you can find the best way to spend the budget, for every feasible value of the budget, neglecting that the budget spent is to subtract from the objective function. Thus, you can use the standard dynamic-programming algorithm. After you have filled the entire dynamic-programming table, you can subtract the corresponding budget spent from the value of every cell of the last row and then look for the best allocation maximizing the difference between expected value and budget spent. Deveop the algorithm by Python.

- **Step 3: Optimization with uncertain ùõº functions.** Focus on the situation in which the binary features cannot be observed and therefore data are aggregated. Design bandit algorithms (combining GP with UCB and TS) to face the case in which the alpha functions are unknown. Deveop the algorithms by Python and evaluate their performance when applied to your simulator.

- **Step 4: Optimization with uncertain ùõº functions and number of items sold.** Do the same of Step 3 to the case in which also the number of items sold per product are uncertain. Deveop the algorithms by Python and evaluate their performance when applied to your simulator.

- **Step 5: Optimization with uncertain graph weights.** Do the same as Step 3 in the case the only uncertain parameters are the graph weights. Develop the algorithms by Python and evaluate their performance when applied to your simulator.

- **Step 6: Non-stationary demand curve.** Now assume that the demand curves could be subjected to some abrupt changes. Use a UCB-like approach with a change detection algorithm to face this situation and show whether it works better or worse than using a sliding-window UCB-like algorithm. Develop the algorithms by Python and evaluate their performance when applied to your simulator.

- **Step 7: Context generation.** Do the same of Step 4 when the features can be observed by the ecommerce website. For simplicity, activate the context-generation algorithms every 2 weeks. With multiple contexts, each single context can be optimized independently of the others. Notice that the split is performed simultaneously over all the campaigns. For instance, if you decide to split over a binary feature, then the split will be performed over all the 5 campaigns simultaneously. This is done to simplify the number of possible splits one can deal with. Once you splitted in multiple contexts, every context can be used to target the ads at best. More precisely, features can be used as target information of the campaigns, thus leading to replicate the campaigns. For instance, if the algorithms split according to a binary feature generating two contexts, then the 5 campaigns are replicated for every single context, say C1 and C2. Reasonably, C1 and C2 will be characterized by different ùõº functions. In this case, the budget optimization problem includes 10 campaigns. This is equivalent to say that we need to decide whether to assign more budget, e.g., to the campaign of P1 for C1 rather than to the campaign of P1 for C2. Develop the algorithms by Python and evaluate their performance when applied to your simulator.
